# üé¨ Movie Fun Fact App

Welcome to the Movie Fun Fact App ‚Äî a full-stack web application that lets users sign in with Google, save their favorite movie, and get fun, AI-generated trivia about it. Built with a focus on clean code, security, and great user experience, this project showcases how modern technologies like Next.js, Prisma, and OpenAI can work together seamlessly.

## What It Does

- **Simple sign-in with Google** ‚Äî no need to remember another password.
- **First-time user flow** ‚Äî users are asked their favorite movie only once.
- **OpenAI-powered fun facts** ‚Äî every time a user refreshes (up to 2 times), they get a new, quirky fact about their favorite movie.
- **Clean and responsive design** ‚Äî built with Tailwind CSS and looks good on desktop or mobile.
- **Polished session handling** ‚Äî built with NextAuth to securely manage users and sessions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: NextAuth with Google OAuth
- **Backend**: API Routes in Next.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (via Prisma)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 (Chat API)
- **Deployment-Ready**: Vercel, Railway, or Docker-compatible

## Project Highlights

- Strong use of TypeScript for end-to-end type safety
- Follows Next.js best practices (file-based routing, API layer)
- Prisma ORM setup with a clean and extendable schema
- Uses `getServerSession()` to ensure protected API access
- Guards in place for invalid movie names and session refresh limits
- Mobile-friendly, responsive UI with smooth transitions
